%% Behavior main analysis
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions 
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions_z
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions_z_touch %based on the tongue position during electric touch, rather than at the peak of the lick

lick2D_video_behavior_across_blocks
lick2D_electric_behavior_across_blocks %this is the same version as lick2D_video_behavior_across_blocks, but based on electric touch, and not video

% Behavior data
lick2D_behaviorperform

% Some other older analysis
lick2D_video_yawmemory_across_blocks2 % consider reusing some analysis from here
lick2D_video_yaw_early_vs_nonearly2 % consider reusing some analysis from here
lick2D_video_yaw_trajectory
lick2D_video_yaw_trajectory_no_goals %same as above but without the targets being plotted, only the centers of trajectories



%% Additional analysis to do:
% within trial variability (angle/x/z position) across blocks/days separately for before lickport appearence and after licport appearence
% number of early licks as a function of block
% all of these separate by naive (2 days) versus expert (2>days)
