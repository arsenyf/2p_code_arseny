%% Behavior main analysis
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions 
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions_z
lick2D_video_behavior_across_sessions_z_touch %based on the tongue position during electric touch, rather than at the peak of the lick

lick2D_video_behavior_across_blocks_naive_vs_experts %(based on video)
lick2D_video_behavior_across_blocks
lick2D_electric_behavior_across_blocks %this is the same version as lick2D_video_behavior_across_blocks, but based on electric touch, and not video

% Behavior data
lick2D_video_licking_stats_reward_increase_omission

% Some other older analysis

lick2D_video_yaw_trajectory
lick2D_video_yaw_trajectory_no_goals %same as above but without the targets being plotted, only the centers of trajectories
